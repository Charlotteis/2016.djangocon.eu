<h1>Welcome to Budapest!</h1>
<p>In a team of 10 web developers, we create sophisticated, beautiful, well functioning web apps and (mobile) websites. We like to work with Open Source software, because we believe in sharing knowledge and we never want to stop innovating.<p>
<p>We love Django because we think it’s the best thing yet. We’re excited about new techniques and the fast pace that Django gives us while developing the next big thing. We’re quit the perfectionists, so we don’t design, we don’t sell and we don’t play bullshit-bingo. It’s al about the code, period :)</p>
